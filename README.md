# Feature Selection using Genetic Algorithm

The selection of features from a dataset that gives optimal classification accuracy reduces
dimensionality, removes irrelevant & redundant features, and improves the performance of
classifier is called feature selection. It is used as a preprocessing step in Machine learning. In
recent days datasets having high dimensionality which increases the training time of the of a
model and decreases efficiency. In this study, a method is proposed for feature selection based
on Filter method and Genetic algorithm. Constant, Quasi constant, Duplicate, and correlated
features are removed using filter method, and after that Genetic algorithm is used to find the
optimal feature subset. Our goal is to eliminate features that give us little or no additional
information and provide most relevant feature subset. Excellent results are given on any of
dataset showing that the algorithm effectively handles datasets having a huge number of
features.
